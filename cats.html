            <h2>Cats</h2>
            <p>
              Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia
              region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in
              the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat
              breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some
              diets and practices are generally recommended for the well-being
              of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

              It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat
              that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if
              possible. Monitor your kitten's growth closely to make sure its
              growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing
              at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten
              directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why
              kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:

            <h2>Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
            <p>
              Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food
              typically around three to four weeks after birth. According to the
              <a
                href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips"
                class="text-link"
                target="_blank"
                >ASPCA</a
              >, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten
              food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your
              kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water
              can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for
              kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for
              growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may
              have different dietary requirements. You should always consult
              with your veterinarian for recommendations.

            <h2>One Year to Seven Years</h2>
            <p>
              This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as
              many nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases,
              and so does their metabolism. It is
              <strong>not</strong> recommended to leave food out for the cats
              all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat
              meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice
              reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline
              ailments.

            <h2>Seven Years and More</h2>
            <p>
              Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate
              and experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less
              fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you
              are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that
              states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and
              <strong>not</strong> just a category (such as fish). This usually
              means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality
              proteins.
