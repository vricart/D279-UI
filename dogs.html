            <h2>Dogs</h2>
            <p>
              The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a
              diverse variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds
              recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers
              mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the
              social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced
              feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show
              medical indicators such as

                blood pressure and improved lipid profiles.</a
              >
              If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for
              your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough
              opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more
              information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
              stages of their lives.

            <h2>Diet &amp; Exercise</h2>
            <p>
              Throughout dogs' lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer
              meals as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two
              months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about
              three to six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced
              to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and
              finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a
              dog's typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70
              percent water. The
              <a
                href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips"
                class="text-link"
                target="_blank"
                >ASPCA</a
              >
              says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness,
              and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your
              pooch hydrated!
            </p>
            <p>
              Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to
              keep their organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The
              minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed
              and size differences, but generally a range of 30 - 120 minutes of
              exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two
              hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading
              this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way,
              exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a
              push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from
              a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure
              they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay
              careful attention to toys that require supervision.

            <h2>Grooming &amp; Handling</h2>
            <p>
              Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health.
              So be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding
              and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
              difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
              especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not
              only important to your dog's health but can be an exercise
              depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse
              <strong>all</strong> of the soap out, as any residual soap can
              result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or
              dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter
              the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your
              canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand
              under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is
              a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms
              perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest
              and rear as you lift.

              You should <strong>always</strong> consult with your veterinarian,
              but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically
              recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such
              as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by
              your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides.
